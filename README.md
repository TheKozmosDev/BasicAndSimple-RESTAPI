# BasicAndSimple-RESTAPI
I learned by building my first REST API and also got into the backend side.

Simple User REST API

This is a simple Spring Boot REST API I created while learning how to build backend applications.
It was one of my first steps into backend development and helped me understand how RESTful endpoints work.

# Features

Get all users
Get user by ID
Get user by first name and last name (query parameters)
    
# Technologies Used

Java (Spring Boot)
Maven
REST API principles

# Endpoints

Method	Endpoint	           Description
GET	    /api/users	         Returns a list of all users
GET	    /api/getuser/{id}	   Returns a user by ID
GET	    /api/userswithparams?firstname={firstname}&lastname={lastname}	Returns a user by first and last name

# Purpose

This project is part of my journey into backend development.
It is a simple and clean example of how to create RESTful services using Spring Boot.
